## üöÄ Distribution

### Sharing the Application

To share the application with others:

1. **Copy the entire project folder** (includes database and resources)
2. **Or share just the JAR file** (target/CafeInventorySystem-1.0-SNAPSHOT-executable.jar)
	   - Recipients will need to create their own database
	   - Application will auto-initialize on first run

### Platform Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Windows (7, 8, 10, 11)
- ‚úÖ macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- ‚úÖ Linux (most distributions)
- ‚úÖ Any system with Java 21+
